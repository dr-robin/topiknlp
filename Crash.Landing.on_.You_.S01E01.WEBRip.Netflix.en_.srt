1
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,515
EPISODE 1

3
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
100 PERCENT PURE CARBONIC ACID

4
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,823
THIS IS THE TASTE OF TRUE BEER

5
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,769
Yes. The story will be published shortly,
at around 7 a.m.

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,565
But I said to Despatch, "Interlocking
fingers doesn't mean they're dating.

7
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
Ask anyone you see on the streets."

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,902
And if you look closely,
they aren't interlocked.

9
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,071
You're holding his wrist.

10
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,366
So I said, "They're obviously not dating."
I strongly denied it,

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,744
and we concluded that you two
are good friends who like to pull pranks.

12
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,081
You call that a prank?

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,459
Yes. I told them you two are very close
and that's how you usually fool around...

14
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,712
I mean, that's how
you two usually hang out.

15
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,224
THOSE TWO ARE DEFINITELY DATING

16
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,020
Right.

17
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,813
We were close.

18
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,357
Although it's all over now.

19
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,323
PLEASE LET ME JUST GO HOME

20
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,949
All right.

21
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,911
It already happened, so it's fine.

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,454
It's all good,

23
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,041
but can you do something
about the blur effect?

24
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,419
Should I tell them to blur your face more?

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
No, that's not what I'm saying.

26
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,800
They blurred my earrings too.

27
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,346
It's the accessory item I'm promoting
the hardest out of the whole collection.

28
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,723
The blur effect should be...
How shall I put this?

29
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,685
Can they carefully shrink it
so that the earrings show right away?

30
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,105
Actually, a full shot would be better.

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
That way, people can see my purse

32
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,817
-and shoes too.
-Got it.

33
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,697
Purchasing Manager.
What should you do, then?

34
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,116
-Pardon me?
-The earrings, purse, and shoes.

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,618
You need to secure enough stock.

36
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,412
Orders will pile up
when they start trending.

37
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,956
Okay.

38
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,428
Who is she? What's with all this fuss?

39
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,306
Isn't that her? The woman
who's supposedly dating actor Cha Sang-u?

40
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,559
You're right. Does she think
she's a celebrity? Why bring bodyguards?

41
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,436
She's not even that pretty.

42
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,146
-He deserves better.
-I bet it's her money.

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,733
I feel like I'm getting way more attention
than I usually do.

44
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,486
Why did you hire these bodyguards?

45
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,864
Oh, in case Cha Sang-u's angry fans
may attack you...

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,324
"Angry fans"?

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,452
Why? I'm the one who should be angry,
not them.

48
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
Ms. Yoon, please calm down.

49
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,290
We did half of our yearly revenue
in just one day.

50
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
The stock price is going up too.

51
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,885
Look at you. Are you a celebrity or what?

52
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,220
Who's this?

53
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
Your eldest brother!

54
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,268
She doesn't even have
her brother's number? That rude stuck-up.

55
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,311
Why did you call?

56
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,272
Hey. Last time, it was a baseball player.

57
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,190
-A soccer player.
-I mean, a soccer player.

58
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,484
And this time, it's an idol singer?

59
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,445
-No, an actor.
-It's an actor?

60
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,821
So? Is that why you called?

61
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,823
You probably don't care to know
what's going on

62
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,743
with our family because
you're too busy embarrassing us,

63
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,703
but didn't you see the news?

64
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,455
Dad's being released on probation today.

65
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,374
I don't care whether or not

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,793
you visit us on the holidays
or for the memorial ceremonies,

67
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,838
-but shouldn't you come by today?
-Is this your number?

68
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,299
Yes, it is.
Can you save it, for heaven's sake?

69
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,633
Don't change your number.

70
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,927
It'd be a hassle
to have to block it twice.

71
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
BLOCK NUMBER

72
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,268
-Damn it.
-Did she hang up on you again?

73
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,687
-This little brat.
-Just leave her be.

74
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,607
It's been years since Se-ri estranged
the whole family. Don't bother.

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,984
I only called her
because Dad wanted me to.

76
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,654
By the way, why did Father
summon all of us today?

77
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,740
That must be it, right?

78
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,827
-Announcing the heir.
-Announcing the heir.

79
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,039
Chairman Yoon Jeung-pyeong
of Queens Group,

80
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,291
who was arrested in March
for violating the Act on

81
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,834
Aggravated Punishment

82
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,504
of Economic Crimes, has been released
on probation after 283 days.

83
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,590
Chairman Yoon has announced
that he will be stepping down,

84
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,967
so all eyes are on who,
between his eldest son, Yoon Se-jun,

85
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
and his second eldest son, Yoon Se-hyeong,

86
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,014
will end up taking over
the leadership of the group.

87
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,641
-Sir.
-Here he comes.

88
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,393
-Please say a few words.
-A comment, please.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,938
-Please tell us!
-Just a comment, please!

90
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,322
What is this?

91
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,282
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELEASE

92
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,868
Father, I made this tofu cake

93
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,329
to congratulate you on your release.

94
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,455
My wife is the best.

95
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,582
-Congratulations, Dad.
-Congratulations!

96
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,795
You seem to be in a great mood today.

97
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,967
I'm so happy
that Father is finally out of jail.

98
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,429
People are only interested
in the power dynamics among the siblings

99
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,308
and who will end up
inheriting the company.

100
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,148
I mean, what's wrong with people?

101
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,526
I guess they think rich people like us
don't even have families.

102
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,153
We're so close, you know.

103
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,488
Right, Sang-a?

104
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,240
Yes, of course.

105
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:36,122
Oh, right. Se-jun, you had a fistfight
with the labor union leader.

106
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,166
Has it all been sorted out?

107
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,464
They're in the process of
reaching a settlement, peacefully.

108
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,757
It can happen when two guys
are trying to talk things out.

109
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,384
Exactly, it happens.

110
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,052
By the way, Sang-a,

111
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
I heard Se-hyeong got duped
by an investment scam.

112
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,682
When?

113
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,768
What can you do about the stock price
plunging 50 percent?

114
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,481
But the fact that people are questioning
your leadership skills and qualifications

115
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,358
makes me so angry.

116
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,946
Just because you fell victim
to a high-value fraud, people call you

117
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,365
an idiot and treat you like a retard.

118
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,909
Who's calling my brother an idiot?

119
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,744
-I heard--
-It's not a fraud.

120
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,288
I just can't get a hold of my friend
at the moment. That's all.

121
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,498
Take care of it,

122
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,541
or all the shareholders will sue you.

123
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
Mind your own business.

124
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,588
Dad, Se-jun beat up the union leader
and broke his tooth.

125
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,715
I promised him
that I'll pay for his dental implant.

126
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,717
-Are you boasting?
-You think I am, retard?

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,220
-What? You prick.
-How dare you call me a prick!

128
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,804
-Where is Se-ri?
-You...

129
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,476
Did you not get the message
that I wanted Se-ri here today?

130
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,729
I tried getting in touch with her
many times,

131
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,856
but it looks like that brat

132
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,275
blocked my number.

133
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,678
Dad, congratulations
on getting out on probation.

134
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,932
I heard you wanted me to be here today.
Is there something you'd like to say?

135
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,392
You should

136
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,394
move back in.

137
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,689
Is that it?

138
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,607
I was wondering why.

139
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,986
You look great.

140
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,405
Look after your health.

141
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,866
I came and said hi, so I'll get going.

142
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,164
I want you to take over my position.

143
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,291
-Dad.
-Father.

144
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,292
Honey.

145
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,299
Listen.

146
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,511
You left home and started your own company
ten years ago.

147
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,555
I've definitely seen what you can do.

148
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,931
So,

149
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,892
I want you to run the company in my place.

150
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,577
-Okay, I'll do that.
-Hey.

151
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,704
-You brat, you don't know anything!
-That's right!

152
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,706
If I'm your successor, will I have

153
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,459
the authority to appoint new CEOs
for our subsidiaries?

154
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,501
Of course, you will.

155
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,879
That's great.

156
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,508
I always thought that a few of the CEOs
are underqualified.

157
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,012
For instance, those who tend
to clash with their employees

158
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,306
and those who often get sued

159
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,143
or have caused the company great damage
due to their own ignorance.

160
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,730
We should fire such CEOs
without any hesitation.

161
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,231
I'll leave it to you.

162
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,776
Thank you.

163
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,487
Give me some time though.

164
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,990
My company recently launched
an extreme-sports apparel line,

165
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,659
so it's grown even bigger.

166
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,036
I'll look for
a good management specialist.

167
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,122
All right.
Can you meet me in my office tomorrow?

168
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
Tomorrow, I can't.

169
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,502
We're doing the final test
on an important new product.

170
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,128
Then,

171
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,715
I plan to announce it at the upcoming
general shareholders' meeting,

172
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,010
so let's meet before that.

173
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,346
Okay.

174
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,932
Then enjoy your dinner, everyone.

175
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,268
You might get indigestion if I stay.
I'm leaving.

176
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,390
Ms. Yoon, when did you learn paragliding?

177
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,808
Did I not tell you?

178
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,978
I got my certification in Interlaken
when I went to Switzerland.

179
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,272
Oh, I see. We could've tested it
and just submitted

180
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,732
a report to you.
You didn't have to do this yourself.

181
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,026
It looks like I'll get quite busy.

182
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,029
I'm in a rush
because I need to climb someplace.

183
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,489
"Climb"? Where?

184
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,451
High up.

185
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,828
You're already in a high place.
So you mean, even higher?

186
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,496
As early as tomorrow morning,

187
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,666
you'll see my name all over the news.

188
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,460
Don't be too surprised.

189
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,170
Will it be another dating scandal?

190
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,800
No.

191
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
All right. Shall we get started?

192
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,141
The wind is quite strong though.

193
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,352
We've checked the weather forecast,
but will you be all right?

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,479
Mr. Hong.

195
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,814
Why does the wind blow?

196
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,941
Well, I'm not sure.

197
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,528
It's blowing to move on,

198
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,614
not to stay.

199
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,201
The wind needs to keep moving

200
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,078
for me to fly.

201
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,476
Ms. Yoon, please be careful!

202
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,896
You're doing a great job, seriously.

203
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,024
You've been working so hard, Se-ri.

204
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,989
Now, I can just soar high up.

205
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,534
This is nice.

206
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,954
Look at the beautiful color of the forest

207
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,623
and the lush green fields.

208
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,085
I haven't seen a scenery like this
in so long.

209
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,797
My gosh.

210
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,134
Look, that tractor is flying in the wind.

211
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,678
Why is that happening?

212
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,104
My gosh.

213
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,637
KOREAN DEMILITARIZED ZONE
NORTHERN LIMIT LINE 1,000M

214
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,392
FOR PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND UNIFICATION
OF KOREAN PENINSULA

215
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,435
Captain Ri.

216
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,981
They're headed in this direction,
judging from the sound of the gunshots.

217
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,402
Maybe it's a deserter from the South.

218
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,904
The combat site is 400m away
from our current location.

219
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
Going in at eleven o'clock.
Total count, ten.

220
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,952
K2 automatic rifle, six in total.

221
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,538
And Tokarev TT-33. Three are in use.

222
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,332
-TT-33?
-They're our comrades.

223
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,644
Step back.

224
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,522
Take one more step,
and you'll be entering our garrison.

225
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,065
GARRISON: MILITARY POST

226
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,693
Hand these three over, and we'll back off.

227
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,611
-They're our comrades.
-Captain.

228
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,407
We got the State Security Department's
approval and came here to hunt deers.

229
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,868
We just got lost because of the tornado.

230
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,787
They crossed the Southern Limit Line

231
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
and got caught
while digging up cultural artifacts.

232
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,207
Can you prove it?

233
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,836
This shows screenshots
from our thermal camera footage.

234
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,296
Is anyone injured?

235
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,217
-No.
-We've gauged the situation,

236
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,844
so let's drop our weapons.

237
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,307
I swear on my country's honor
that we will strictly punish them.

238
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,184
When it comes to punishment,

239
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,395
we, the North, certainly outdo the South.

240
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,817
We'll drop our weapons
on the count of three.

241
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,778
One.

242
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,530
Two.

243
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,450
Three.

244
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,380
MILITARY POLICE

245
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,115
Alpha One.
Just return. Don't get into conflict.

246
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,534
-Don't get into conflict with the North.
-Thunderbolt One.

247
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,535
Do you hear me?

248
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,746
No conflict with the South.
Return at once.

249
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,085
Greetings, sir.

250
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,838
Company Five is on standby
to transfer the grave robbers,

251
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,757
whom we arrested
while patrolling the demilitarized zone.

252
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
Company Five Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

253
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
Good work.

254
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,139
Anything else?

255
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,684
Because of the tornado earlier in the day,

256
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,812
a lot of the barbed-wire fences
fell down along with the trees.

257
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,482
The high-voltage transformer for
the electric fence isn't working either.

258
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,319
We should tighten security
for the areas with the damages

259
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,404
until everything is fixed.

260
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,822
Yes, we should.

261
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,119
Is it tomorrow? The company switch.

262
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,370
Yes, sir.

263
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,664
What a shame.
All of this happened on your last day.

264
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,751
From the tornado to the grave robbers.

265
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,085
That's okay, sir.

266
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,507
They probably crossed
the Southern Limit Line

267
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,760
due to a misunderstanding.

268
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,762
Let's be lenient.

269
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,056
It happened inside our patrol zone.

270
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,515
It cannot be taken lightly.

271
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,185
You're well aware of the fact
that the State Security Department

272
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,021
issued them the pass
to enter the demilitarized zone.

273
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,065
Nothing good will come out of this

274
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,983
being brought up at the final assessment.

275
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,987
So the State Security Department
gave those grave robbers permission

276
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,573
to cross the Southern Limit Line
and steal artifacts.

277
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,533
Is that what you're saying?

278
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,581
Of course not, Captain Ri.

279
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,375
I promised the captain from the South

280
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,085
that we will investigate this matter.

281
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,419
I wish to keep that promise.

282
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,881
All right. Go ahead
and keep your promise, then.

283
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,677
But can I make a promise too, Captain Ri?

284
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,848
I, Jo Cheol Gang, never go easy on anyone
no matter what their ranks are.

285
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,811
If you commit any act
that may threaten our army's security

286
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,814
and get caught by me,
you will be finished on the spot.

287
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,112
Of course,
you'll never do anything like that.

288
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,780
But they say

289
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,658
that a thing or a person

290
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,161
is bound to change all the time.

291
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,330
Isn't that how life is, after all?

292
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,879
Gosh, don't even get me started.

293
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,217
If he gets that cocky
with a State Security Department officer,

294
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,677
what's going to happen to us?

295
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,972
I guess he'll look all cool and tough,

296
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:52,728
but the State Security Department
will keep a close watch on us

297
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,939
from now on because of it.
That's what I'm trying to say.

298
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,942
By the way, how did Captain Ri
end up at the outpost line?

299
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,737
He's from Pyongyang,
so he probably has a high status.

300
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,488
Why not just enjoy
a comfortable life there?

301
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,034
That's why they say
you've got to watch out for the rich.

302
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,953
From front to back,
they want everything under their control

303
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,332
so that they can forever win
General Kim's love.

304
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,667
-I see.
-All right.

305
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:20,464
Just know that this wine is from 1953,

306
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,719
which was before the armistice was signed.

307
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,262
-Oh, my.
-All right.

308
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,307
Just one glass of this 60-year-old
snake wine

309
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,644
can make even those suffering
from malnutrition jump around with vigor.

310
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,106
-This is medicine, not wine.
-Medicine.

311
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,817
Then I'd love a glass of this medicine.

312
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,153
Sure thing.

313
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,613
-Here.
-Thank you.

314
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,031
Enjoy. All right, you're next.

315
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,785
But is it okay to drink like this
while on duty?

316
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,081
Hey, we worked day and night
for two months straight.

317
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,374
The company switch will happen
in the morning,

318
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,751
so it will be fine.

319
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,743
-You cannot go in.
-Please.

320
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,828
My boss...

321
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,663
My boss is a lady.

322
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,249
Gosh, excuse me. Wait!

323
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,291
My gosh.

324
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,876
119 RESCUE SERVICES

325
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,712
Please calm down.

326
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,552
-Sir, you must keep out.
-Let go!

327
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,011
Wait!

328
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,305
Excuse me! Hey.

329
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,267
-Where's my boss?
-I don't know.

330
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,185
Didn't you record anything?
Where's the camera?

331
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,771
-In that situation? I couldn't.
-What did you do, then?

332
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,897
I nearly died!

333
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,775
-Okay, but where is Ms. Yoon?
-I'm going to sue you people!

334
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,110
What are you talking about?

335
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,988
Wait. Gosh, this is nuts.
How unprofessional.

336
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,157
I told her we could just submit
a report to her.

337
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,201
Why did she suddenly want
to do this herself? This is crazy.

338
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,580
She talked about
going high up or something.

339
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,251
How far have you gone, Ms. Yoon?

340
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,702
What?

341
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,289
Did I faint?

342
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,708
Gosh.

343
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,043
Where am I?

344
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,050
It hurts.

345
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,803
What is this place?

346
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,393
This is Se-ri. Answer me, Mr. Hong.

347
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,521
Hello?

348
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,233
What the hell?

349
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,570
Where am I?

350
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,782
Am I at a national park or what?

351
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,204
Gosh! My goodness.

352
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,122
This is too high.

353
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,042
Hello?

354
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,671
Hello? Anybody around?

355
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,342
Help! Anybody around?

356
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,097
Didn't you hear something just now?

357
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,100
Pardon? I didn't hear anything, sir.

358
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,687
A woman's voice.
It sounded like she was crying.

359
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,647
Stop it. You're scaring me.

360
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,857
This is Owl. Pigeon, answer.

361
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,653
This is Pigeon. What's the matter?

362
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,988
You'll have to come here.

363
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,950
The tornado damaged
all the barricades and sand plates.

364
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,285
Okay.

365
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,037
-Captain Ri.
-You go ahead.

366
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,455
I'll look around this area.

367
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,291
Yes, sir.

368
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,070
Here! Someone's here!

369
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,741
You're a soldier.

370
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,494
Is the army nearby dispatched to find me?

371
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,426
-Password.
-What?

372
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,971
What is that?

373
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,517
Don't come near. Talk to me from there.

374
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,644
Talk to me from there.

375
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,688
Come down.

376
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,065
I wish I could go down,

377
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,193
but as you can see, it's so high up here.

378
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,529
And I don't have any energy left.

379
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,909
Oh, my. I'm coming down.
I'm unbuckling now.

380
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
State your occupation and name.

381
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,353
Well, I work for a fashion company.

382
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,607
I don't think you will know its name.

383
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:18,279
And I don't feel comfortable telling you
my name because we just met.

384
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,492
And...

385
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:28,123
You made a tough decision.
Welcome to the Republic of Korea.

386
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,707
"Republic of Korea"?

387
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,001
What was it called?

388
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,505
Defector. You're a defector
from North Korea, right?

389
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,926
Maybe you're not.

390
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,846
An armed communist...

391
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,265
Or a spy?

392
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,020
Are you

393
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,814
a North Korean elite

394
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,901
urgently dispatched

395
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,823
in order to carry out a special mission?

396
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,202
Whatever you are, don't worry.
I will not report you or anything.

397
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,873
I don't mind others' business at all.
I'm busy with my own business.

398
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,000
-Now if you'll excuse me.
-Halt.

399
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,501
I halted. Look. I'm standing still.

400
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,385
Listen.

401
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,054
Could you just let me go home?

402
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,807
-Where do you live?
-Seoul, Gangnam-gu, Cheong...

403
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,936
I can't give you any further details.

404
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,605
It's a long way.

405
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,733
I will find my way.
Thanks for your concern.

406
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,568
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

407
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,321
I didn't come to the South.

408
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,199
-Pardon?
-You came to the North.

409
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,789
North? North Korea?

410
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,672
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

411
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,633
How is this place...

412
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,141
Seriously?

413
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,645
Come on. Stop kidding me.

414
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,110
No way.

415
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,947
We're at the demilitarized zone,
the 38th parallel.

416
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,783
-It's the Northern Limit Line.
-"Demilitarized zone"?

417
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,160
The place where the film
Joint Security Area was set in?

418
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,704
Then this is not completely North Korea.

419
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,415
It's the territory of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

420
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,168
And an unidentified South Korean
trespassed on the land.

421
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,003
-You'll go through legal procedures--
-Wait.

422
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,007
I didn't trespass. Look over there.

423
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,302
I was paragliding.

424
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,096
The weather was all sunny and great.

425
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,139
But then suddenly it went crazy
and a tornado came,

426
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,600
which wasn't even on the weathercast.
Tractors and pigs were

427
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,853
all flying around
and the flood carried away people.

428
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,814
I was carried away by the wind too.
Then I passed out.

429
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,525
And I found myself here.

430
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,530
So what I'm saying is, it was an accident.
It couldn't be helped.

431
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,245
Okay.

432
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,415
Thank you. You understand.

433
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,625
Explain like that
when you are investigated.

434
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,963
What? Why would I be investigated?

435
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,548
According to the law of the republic,

436
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,717
voluntary enterers must be tied up
and investigated.

437
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,760
Tied up? You will tie me up?

438
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,596
You flew over
on an unpowered flying vehicle.

439
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,598
We can't send you back
without any investigation.

440
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,851
Then what if they frame me

441
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:39,856
as a beautiful spy
or a beautiful secret agent,

442
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,151
torture me, and send me
to places like Aoji Coal Mine?

443
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,527
Then what do I do?

444
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,446
That won't happen.

445
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,656
-Are you sure?
-I can't say I'm sure.

446
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,285
Then how am I supposed to trust you?
Would you if you were me?

447
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,412
Whether you trust me or not
is not my business.

448
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,997
Come on.

449
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,541
Don't be so irresponsible.

450
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,630
I think it won't take long if I run.

451
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,090
Please just let me go. Please.

452
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,176
I'm a really good runner.

453
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,011
I will be gone in no time.

454
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,347
-I won't cause any harm to you.
-Halt.

455
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,183
If you turn a blind eye to this,
you're saving a person's life.

456
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,101
Wait. That's a minefield.

457
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,604
Mine?

458
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
Where?

459
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,192
There are many lost mines there.

460
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,819
They were carried away by the heavy rain
and buried out of sight.

461
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,531
I'm an expert in that area.

462
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,952
Do you think you can get out
without my help?

463
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,454
I get it, but could you just stay there?

464
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,581
Why does he keep approaching?

465
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,919
If you don't listen to me and move,
you might lose your ankle...

466
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,303
-What's the matter?
-I'm fine.

467
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,055
You don't seem fine.

468
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,223
I said I'm fine.

469
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,142
I think you stepped on a lost mine.

470
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,646
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

471
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,148
Are you sure?

472
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,402
Are you sure you don't need my help?

473
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,072
Then try moving and turning around.

474
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,118
You can't move.

475
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,203
This is Mountain Hawk. This is Mountain...

476
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,463
This is Pigeon. Answer, Mountain Hawk

477
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,302
This is Pigeon. Answer, Mountain Hawk

478
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,895
Thank you.

479
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,065
Don't thank me. I'm not giving it to you.

480
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,152
Don't forget that I have a gun in my hand.

481
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,279
Don't forget that if you shoot me,

482
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,198
you're losing the only person
who can help you.

483
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,327
By the way, I don't have
much knowledge in that area.

484
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,913
Do experts sometimes step on mines too?

485
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,585
If you keep standing like that,
your feet will go numb.

486
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,628
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

487
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,715
You keep saying you're okay,
so I'll just head off.

488
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,800
I have a lot of things to do. Well, then.

489
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,177
Fine.

490
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,263
Leave that at least.

491
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,902
It will soon drift down to you.

492
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,946
I need some time to escape too.
You understand me, right?

493
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,288
I'm in huge trouble myself,
so I don't have the time

494
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,540
to worry about others.

495
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,250
Bye.

496
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,841
Don't shoot me from the back.
That's just sneaky.

497
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you see the rectangular box
in front of you?

498
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,515
-I do.
-That's a PMD series mine.

499
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,017
Why are there so many mines here?

500
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,936
Try to stay as close to the bank
as possible.

501
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,317
Keep watching your step.

502
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,987
I'm saying this
because we will never meet again.

503
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,868
Your looks are totally my type.

504
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,413
If our countries reunite,
let's meet a different occasion.

505
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,957
How could you

506
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,626
make a joke in this situation?

507
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,754
By the way, which way is the South?

508
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,761
Keep following the path,
then you will meet a forked road.

509
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,012
Then...

510
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,808
go to the right.

511
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,312
Can I trust you?

512
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,814
Stop asking and make a decision.

513
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,232
I already said my answer.

514
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,904
Captain Ri.

515
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,031
Is everything okay?

516
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,533
-Captain Ri.
-I'm here!

517
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,423
Captain Ri.

518
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,051
I've been looking for you.

519
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,344
Tell the troops

520
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,681
to arrest anyone suspicious
found in the area.

521
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,349
Is it a voluntary enterer?

522
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,059
Or is it a spy?

523
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,938
It's a South Korean woman
who came by an accident.

524
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,691
Arrest her without shooting her.
Forward the command.

525
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,276
Yes, sir.

526
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,032
This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.

527
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,202
This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.

528
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,579
Who is looking for Cuckoo?

529
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,457
This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.

530
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,253
I sent the command by radio.

531
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,886
Captain Ri.

532
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
Is everything okay?

533
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,187
Did you...

534
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,439
Don't worry.

535
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,191
I will call the engineer corps right away.

536
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,319
Why don't you do it,
First Lieutenant Park?

537
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,113
You have disarmed mines, right?

538
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,366
Just once when I was a recruit.

539
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,123
I trust you.

540
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,209
I will do my best, sir.

541
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,216
Wait. Are you going to do it
with bare hands?

542
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,515
You need to remove the safety pin
with this first.

543
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,475
Yes, sir. Don't worry, sir.

544
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,269
Be careful.

545
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,897
If you don't remove the pin correctly,
you might hit the fuse.

546
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,941
Yes, sir.

547
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,861
Be extra careful with that part.

548
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,292
Make sure to do it gently.

549
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,671
Be careful.

550
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,808
You said you trusted me.

551
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,272
I did.

552
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,070
-Is it over?
-Yes, it's over, sir.

553
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,376
Let's go.

554
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,003
Yes, sir.

555
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,805
He said I should go right.

556
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,308
I must trust him. There's no other way.

557
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,310
He didn't look like he would lie.

558
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,773
How do I trust him? He's from the North.
This must be a scheme.

559
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,372
A South Korean woman seems to

560
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,208
have stumbled into our area.

561
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,544
We were told to shoot her right away,

562
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,797
so she must be some kind of an armed spy.

563
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,465
-A spy?
-An armed spy?

564
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,009
Gosh. First grave robbers, and now a spy.

565
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,804
All this happened just before
I switch commands. I'm so unlucky.

566
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,306
I'm totally exhausted.

567
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,267
Hey, spread out in pairs.

568
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,353
Yes, sir. Let's go.

569
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,065
Why couldn't she just come tomorrow
after we switch commands?

570
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,776
Then the 6th company would
have taken the job.

571
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,070
Still, if we catch the armed spy,

572
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,696
we will be rewarded well.

573
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,699
Master Sergeant Pyo, you need a promotion.

574
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,744
-A promotion?
-Yes, sir.

575
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:20,292
Then maybe an infallible marksman,
Pyo Chi Su, should make a move.

576
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,211
-Master Sergeant.
-Yes.

577
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,672
-I think I have to go to the toilet.
-Go ahead.

578
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
I was wondering when I will receive
the General's medal.

579
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,567
I guess it's today.

580
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,330
Did I

581
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,040
see it wrong?

582
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,211
There she is.

583
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,887
Hey, stay still. If she was still,
I would've definitely shot her.

584
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,056
That damn woman is freaking fast.

585
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,608
Is she a ghost or what?

586
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,694
This is Cuckoo.

587
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,446
I request backup.

588
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,199
Goodness.

589
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,170
Why are they chasing me?
I thought I was free to go.

590
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,850
MINEFIELD

591
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,562
But that area is packed with mines.

592
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,028
UNCHECKED MINEFIELD

593
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,077
Why is she running over a minefield?

594
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,663
Our fence is over there.

595
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,460
You two.
Follow her along the left clear path.

596
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,254
-I'll take the right path.
-Yes, sir.

597
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,133
That damn woman!

598
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,024
Stop there!

599
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,610
-Damn it.
-Stop there, woman!

600
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,529
Come here!

601
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,824
Hey! Come here!

602
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,410
We will not kill you.

603
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,372
Hey! You! That woman is crazy.

604
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,791
-Why is she going there?
-How did they come here?

605
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,253
No. Don't go.

606
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:14,049
That's not the way back to your country!

607
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,801
Come back here!

608
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,053
-What?
-That's the wrong way!

609
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,222
-Come back!
-What are they saying?

610
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,641
If you go there, we will all die!

611
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,893
Don't go!

612
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,439
-That's not the right way!
-Don't go!

613
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,073
What an idiot.

614
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,784
Why did she cross that fence?

615
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,581
What do we do, sir?

616
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,166
Radio the guard post first.

617
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,211
This is Cuckoo. Answer, Seagull.

618
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,173
This is Cuckoo. Answer, Seagull.

619
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,010
Seagull. Hey! Seagull!

620
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,014
"People in love are meant to meet.

621
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,600
No matter how far you travel,

622
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,060
in the end,

623
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,979
you will come back."

624
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,413
Put that necklace on.

625
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,628
Dear my proud son, Eun Dong.

626
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,507
Are you staying healthy in the army?

627
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,176
Ten years could be a long time
or a short time,

628
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,928
depending on how you think of it.

629
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,807
I wish you finish
your ten years of service safely

630
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,310
and come back home
with a hero's medal on your chest.

631
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,520
Mother.

632
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,429
SE-RI

633
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,478
The person you have called
is not available...

634
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,490
Hello.

635
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,118
Secretary Na.

636
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,621
What?

637
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,957
What are you talking about?

638
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,126
Today,

639
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,880
I want to ask you for intercessory prayer.

640
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,840
My husband and I have

641
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,761
faced an unexpected crisis.

642
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:52,059
All we did was to be nice,
and this is how it paid off.

643
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,521
That low-class...

644
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,898
someone is

645
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,235
coveting my husband's position.

646
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,444
MY HUSBAND

647
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,448
Since my husband is
the eldest son in the family,

648
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,908
he should...

649
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,118
MY HUSBAND

650
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,205
Please excuse me for a second. I'm sorry.

651
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,043
Honey.

652
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,754
I'm at the prayer meeting.
I'll call you when it's over.

653
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,964
Se-ri is missing.

654
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,131
What?

655
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,093
What? Really?

656
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,012
Okay.

657
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,182
Please keep me updated.

658
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,226
Okay.

659
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,232
Goodness.

660
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,448
Ms. Do, what's the matter?

661
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,284
You see.

662
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,078
I didn't even start the prayer,

663
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,080
but God has responded already.

664
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,498
-Praise God.
-Hallelujah.

665
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,713
Helicopters, drones, probes, search dogs.

666
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,632
We are using every method we can use
for the search.

667
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,884
-So don't worry.
-Well.

668
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,012
I'm sure you'll take care of it.

669
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,516
What worries us the most is...

670
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,936
the press.

671
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,980
Once the reporters begin
to write articles,

672
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,148
things will get complicated.

673
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,317
-The stock price will drop too.
-Right.

674
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
Don't worry about that.

675
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,737
The incident will be reported,

676
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,906
but we will keep
the personal information secret.

677
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,201
In this case, how long is the golden hour?

678
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,829
This is a disaster situation,

679
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,873
so there's no fixed golden hour,

680
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,125
but from my personal experience,

681
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,252
It's about 48 hours.

682
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,129
-That long?
-That's long.

683
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,881
-Excuse me?
-If she is alive,

684
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,008
she should have called us by now.

685
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,093
You said she wasn't
in nearby hospitals either.

686
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,970
It's been already over ten hours.

687
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,515
The chances that she's alive
must be pretty low.

688
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,768
-Right?
-Right.

689
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,771
You have dogs. Bring more dogs.

690
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,649
Look at how big the land is.

691
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,150
At this rate, it will take forever.

692
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,695
-Sir, we're already--
-There's nobody over there.

693
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,323
No one is searching over there.

694
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,207
You said you would leave.

695
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,376
You said you would disown our family.

696
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,053
I guess you want to take
what you can take.

697
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,057
Tell Dad that you can't do it.

698
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,063
Whenever I get startled

699
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,274
or scared, I still say this.

700
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,818
"Mom!"

701
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,363
How funny is that?

702
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,408
Because I don't have a mom.

703
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,704
What kind of mother wants
her daughter to be gone?

704
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,164
Right?

705
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,003
Mom!

706
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,810
See? It's not supposed to get ripped
in this situation.

707
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,271
As soon as I get back,

708
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,981
I will fail this product.

709
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,358
You guys are so dead.

710
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,214
I crossed the fence,

711
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,717
but why is there no one here?

712
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,552
What's going on?

713
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,765
Are all the soldiers on leave or what?

714
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,938
-It's all because of me--
-That's not true.

715
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,106
It's because of me.

716
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,941
Hey.

717
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,903
What's the point in finding whom to blame?

718
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,864
If you put it that way,
Captain Ri is the first one to lose her

719
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,365
because he stepped on a mine,

720
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,493
so he has the responsibility too.

721
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,915
I mean, Captain Ri would never have

722
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,751
intended to step on it either.

723
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,129
Everyone knows
that place is full of lost mines.

724
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,340
Even raw recruits know that.

725
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,051
I'm sure he was being careful enough.
Still, he stepped on it.

726
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,803
What can we do about that?

727
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,640
Master Sergeant Pyo, did you drink?

728
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,100
What?

729
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,356
Well, I didn't drink alcohol.

730
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,066
I just had a glass of medicine.

731
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,986
Again,

732
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,281
there's no point in finding whom to blame.

733
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,784
We must hurry and find that woman.

734
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,411
If that woman gets caught
by the State Security Department,

735
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,832
we will all be dead meat.

736
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,749
"Dead meat"?

737
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,462
We will walk into a prison

738
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,005
and come out dead.

739
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,757
Prison?

740
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,634
A dishonorable discharge

741
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,386
at best.

742
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,264
Mother.

743
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,653
It's time for the company switch.

744
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,154
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

745
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,447
Attention.

746
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,368
MY PROUD HOMELAND

747
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,913
Company Five has completed
transferring the task at the guard post.

748
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,540
Captain of Company Five, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

749
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,390
How did that unpowered aircraft reach

750
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,183
our land?

751
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,227
It's precisely because it's unpowered.

752
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,980
Had it been powered,
the radar would have caught it

753
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,690
no matter the wind.

754
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,067
The thermographic camera can't catch
unpowered aircraft,

755
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,445
so you miss it
if you don't spot it with your eyes.

756
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,199
If wind carried her over the border,

757
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,454
-that woman must be panicking.
-Hey!

758
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,166
I am panicking, too!

759
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,919
We will catch her
before the words get out, right?

760
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,503
We must catch her

761
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,297
no matter what.

762
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,652
Why does it feel like I was here before?

763
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,697
I shouldn't wander any longer.

764
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,911
I won't come back here.

765
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,748
Let's not meet again.

766
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,999
Bye.

767
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,781
How is the search going?

768
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,284
You saw how widespread the search is.

769
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,286
That's your problem.

770
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,664
I am not talking about the search
for Yoon Se-ri.

771
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,126
Yoon Se-ri isn't the one
you should be looking for.

772
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,169
What are you talking about?

773
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,214
Stop quizzing me and say what you want.

774
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,633
The position

775
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,552
is open.

776
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
It's open right now.

777
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
Will you miss your chance again?

778
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,518
This is the last chance.

779
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,437
If you don't want to lose it forever,

780
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,022
find him right away.

781
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,526
The man who ran away with your money,
Gu Seung-jun.

782
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,700
SHENYANG, CHINA

783
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,011
Guard the door.

784
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,804
Let me know if you see someone suspicious.

785
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,139
Yes, sir.

786
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,189
Is he trustworthy?

787
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,982
My goodness.

788
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:04,360
You know how carefully I choose my people.

789
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,904
He is trustworthy.

790
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,781
How about you, Mr. Oh?

791
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,907
Are you trustworthy?

792
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,245
You should know that I am trustworthy
at this point.

793
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,665
That was exactly what I said
before I backstabbed Yoon Se-hyeong.

794
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,459
You have a point.

795
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,962
You are incredible.

796
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,466
Mr. Yoon must be in a lot of trouble.

797
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,637
He isn't the type to give up so easily.

798
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,264
He must have followed my trail
to the Philippines by now.

799
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,475
To follow my trail here,

800
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,478
it would take four days tops.
Where should I go from here?

801
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,606
That's right.
With enough money and manpower,

802
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,984
you could chase someone to anywhere
in the world.

803
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,613
One place is an exception.

804
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,281
Internet,

805
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,035
Interpol, and phone roaming

806
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,121
are all useless at that place.

807
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,497
So where is that place?

808
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,833
Hurry up and tell me, would you?

809
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,960
INVESTIGATION OFFICE
OF THE CIVILIAN POLICE BATTALION

810
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,423
Sir.

811
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,758
Sit down.

812
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,260
Relax and eat.

813
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,904
We were quite successful this time.

814
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,574
We have some Goryeo celadon pottery
and a gold Buddha statue.

815
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,742
The Buddha statue is
in the best condition.

816
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,494
There is a gold chamber pot too.

817
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,789
Good work.

818
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,087
Where are the goods?

819
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,177
Are you certain?

820
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,428
Of course.

821
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,599
By the way, what will become of us?

822
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,727
Things got out of hand
because of that damned captain.

823
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,147
We won't be deported
to Pyongyang, will we?

824
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,318
Ri Jeong Hyeok is no match of mine.

825
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,695
Prepare to receive your rewards.

826
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,238
Thank you.

827
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,157
Your food will go cold.

828
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:15,950
Eat.

829
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,981
I NEED A RIDE

830
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,887
What? Open the door!

831
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,389
Open the door!

832
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,557
Open the door!

833
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,064
There are people inside.

834
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,985
My goodness.

835
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,311
Captain.

836
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,188
That woman wouldn't have made it
out of here safely.

837
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,608
She could have gotten eaten by a boar.

838
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:16,904
There would be no need to notify
the State Security Department.

839
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,781
What do you mean?

840
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,867
Geum Eun Dong is

841
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,163
the head of a big family which comprises
of a single mother and four siblings.

842
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,373
Eun Dong's mother is waiting

843
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,501
for her son to return as a hero.

844
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,842
It's the same for every parent.

845
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,806
Since Kim Ju Meok watched
a South Korean drama during work hours,

846
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,767
he might not be able to make it to...

847
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,519
His father might beat him to death first.

848
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,692
If you commit a crime,
it's natural to receive a punishment.

849
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,404
It applies to Geum Eun Dong
and Kim Ju Meok who left their posts

850
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,032
as well as me
who failed to capture that woman

851
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,202
and you

852
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,954
who drank during work.

853
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,499
Captain.

854
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,840
Here.

855
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,356
Thank goodness.

856
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,569
I am home.

857
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,032
I nearly ended up going to North Korea.

858
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,536
What happened today

859
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,205
deserves an interview with CNN.

860
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,590
I will go to the town,

861
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,050
borrow a phone,

862
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,887
and call a taxi so that I can go home.

863
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,015
I will have Dr. Im come over and receive
physical therapy.

864
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,184
I am almost home.

865
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,644
I am almost home.

866
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,448
Why is this place so dark?

867
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,700
Is everyone asleep?

868
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,337
Excuse me. May I borrow your cellphone?

869
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,012
What? Let's go.

870
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,347
Let's go.

871
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,267
Come on. Let's go.

872
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,613
Comrade, your briquette didn't go out
during the night, did it?

873
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,157
No, it didn't.

874
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,827
Comrade, have you been well
throughout the night?

875
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,662
Did you sleep well?

876
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,080
Yes.

877
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,711
Oh, we have electricity now.

878
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,257
We are only getting it
when the sun is about to go up.

879
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,718
But it's nice to have electricity
before we start to cook breakfast.

880
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,679
That's true.

881
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,765
Why did you come ten minutes late today?

882
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,725
It wasn't intentional, okay?

883
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,310
Give me food waste.

884
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,396
Here you go. Give me chicken egg tickets.

885
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,523
Here are ten chicken egg tickets.

886
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,317
Hurry up and give me the eggs.

887
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,569
You collected a lot.

888
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,487
You are so diligent.

889
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,822
Those people...

890
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,866
What are they doing?

891
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,701
They are still warm.

892
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,286
You are right.

893
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,954
-All right, everyone.
-Mom!

894
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,956
-Here it is.
-Let's get started

895
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,459
with the daily exercise routine.

896
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,337
-Let's go.
-Come on out.

897
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,672
Let's hurry up.

898
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,569
THE GREAT LEADER IS ALWAYS WITH US

899
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,636
-Comrade Rim Jin Ju.
-Here.

900
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,763
-Comrade Jeong Woo Pil.
-Here.

901
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,308
-Comrade Park Eun Byeol.
-What are they doing?

902
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,352
Comrade Park Eun Byeol isn't here yet.

903
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,145
-She is always late!
-What's with the accent?

904
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,189
We will be late for school
if we wait for her.

905
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,649
Let's go without her.

906
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,691
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

907
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,943
Forward march!

908
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,487
-Where are we?
-Where are we?

909
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,530
-We reached the town
-We reached the town

910
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,157
-Where are we going?
-Where are we going?

911
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,951
-Going to school
-Going to school

912
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,953
-Why are we going?
-Why are we going?

913
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,621
-Going to study
-Going to study

914
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,623
-Going with whom?
-Going with whom?

915
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,416
-We are going together
-We are going together

916
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,127
PARADISE OF PEOPLE

917
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,589
THE GREAT LEADER IS ALWAYS WITH US

918
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,888
-We reached the town
-We reached the town

919
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,932
-Where are we going?
-Where are we going?

920
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,433
-Going to school
-Going to school

921
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,394
-Why are we going?
-Why are we going?

922
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,187
-Going to study
-Going to study

923
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,147
-Going with whom?
-Going with whom?

924
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,440
What?

925
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,612
Am I still in North Korea?

926
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,995
Mr. Hong.

927
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,665
Hello. Hello.

928
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,001
Mr. Hong.

929
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,129
You can hear me, right?
I know you can hear me.

930
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,048
Fire the event company.

931
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,133
Did they even check the weather?

932
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,594
How could they be so careless?

933
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,554
Once I go back, I won't let you...

934
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,891
No, no.

935
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,810
I will let you be.

936
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,687
I promise I will let you be.

937
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,981
I am not mad.

938
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,734
You aren't answering
because you think I am mad, right?

939
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,947
I am not mad. I am really okay.

940
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,907
So please answer me.

941
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,368
I think...

942
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,956
I am in some kind of a national park.

943
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,999
I saw an elk earlier.

944
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,753
See if there is a national park nearby.

945
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,465
It might sound like an order,

946
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,467
but it's a request.

947
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,974
Come on.

948
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,102
Don't do this to me.

949
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,272
I have so much work.

950
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,108
I have a mountain of work.

951
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,153
For example,

952
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,823
I was planning
to give the employees a raise

953
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,992
and a big bonus.

954
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,161
Did you hear that?

955
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,495
I bet you did.

956
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,540
You are too embarrassed
to answer me so suddenly, right?

957
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,048
Anyone,

958
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:43,387
please come to me.

959
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,063
Here!

960
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:54,899
Here!

961
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,734
Here!

962
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,865
-I come from a rich family in South Korea.
-I'm not interested.

963
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:07,703
Won't all of you in huge trouble
if people find out that I'm hiding here?

964
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,163
That means you'll get kicked out.

965
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,081
-I heard you need this job.
-They said she died.

966
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,584
He's in hiding
after the one-billion-won scheme.

967
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,170
I guess there might be a new account.

968
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:17,922
Why are you here?

969
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,383
His resume doesn't have anything
about family background.

970
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,677
Everything will look suspicious.

971
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,721
-I want to return the favor.
-You don't have to.

972
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,264
There was no favor to begin with.
