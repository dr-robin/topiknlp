00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,120
Legend

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,220
 Brother

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,910
 Friends

 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,950
Timing and Subtitles brought by The Perfect Secretaries Team @ Viki 

8
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,210
Yumyung Group's vice chairman, Lee Yeong Joon.

9
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,100
After becoming vice chairman, he's increased the group's profits by more than twice the previous amount.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,690
Because of that he was selected as the number one and most successful, among the youngest CEOs.

11
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,030
When it comes to a great body, face, or how well his suits fit. Ah, he's got everything.

12
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,420
- But, rumors have it that he won't let a single woman touch him.
- That's right.

13
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,680
That doesn't make sense. I've actually been meeting up with him recently.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,230
Of course, he doesn't let me touch him.

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
- Oppa!
- Vice Chairman!

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,530
Why did she do that?

17
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,210
What?

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,800
Why did Secretary Kim do that?

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,740
Why is she like that?

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,340
 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim? 

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,150
- Episode 1 -

22
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,410
Today I've prepared a monotone tie that suits an intellectual and modern-looking image.

23
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,660
- It looks okay.
- Thank you.

24
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,130
Isn't it bright?

25
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,460
The sunlight?

26
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,950
No...

27
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,150
The aura emanating from me.

28
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,920
Yes, it is blinding. Here is the schedule for today.

29
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,360
It's Executive Kim. Should I answer it?

30
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,670
No, he will for sure say that the contract in Vietnam didn't go well.

31
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,350
I don't want to listen to a sinner and ruin my mood from the morning.

32
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,560
A sinner?

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Harming others or stealing are not only sins.

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,860
Incompetence, but also being ignorant of his incompetence is also a sin.

35
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,010
- Secretary Kim, do you perhaps know? 
 - What?

36
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,120
- How can a person be incompetent?
- I know, right?

37
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,470
Trying and achieving, it's simple. Why can't they do that?

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,180
All people are not like you, Vice Chairman.

39
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,480
- Really? 
- Of course.

40
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,570
In my entire life, I have not seen someone as perfect as you, Vice Chairman.

41
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,020
Who is it?

42
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,980
This time, it's someone who's committed a grave sin.

43
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,060
How should I take care of it?

44
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,850
We've arrived.

45
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,840
Vice Chairman! It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

46
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,890
During working hours, does it make sense that you're going out to get sexual services?

47
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,170
- As an executive director, are you not thinking of our company image?
- I'm sorry.

48
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,180
'M' Group Executive Was Caught Receiving Sexual Services During Working Hours

49
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,790
- Secretary Kim! 
- Yes.

50
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,310
- Next schedule.  
 There's an executive meeting in the new building.

51
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,050
You know it's prohibited to smoke indoors.

52
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,940
Vice Chairman, Vice Chairman, Vice Chairman!

53
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,220
Vice Câ€” Vice Chairman.

54
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,260
Executive Director Jo, don't be too upset.

55
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,750
With the cancellation of the project and now the sexual service article,

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,060
Vice Chairman had a lot of expectations and was let down, so he's upset like that.

57
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,480
To be honest, trying to stop the name of our company from spreading through this article

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,400
was especially hard for the vice chairman.

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,900
Secretary Kim, why did I do that?

60
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,720
I must have been possessed by something. (meaning I was out of my mind)

61
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,810
Don't forget how you're reflecting now, so you can live better from now on.

62
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,540
How about leaving early today and getting some rest?

63
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,720
Should I?

64
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,440
I will be more careful starting tomorrow.

65
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,440
Secretary Im, I'm going to get off work first.

66
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,660
Excuse me, does this mean that he can keeping working still?

67
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,270
Take care of all of Executive Director Jo's desk and possessions immediately.

68
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,130
Have you ever seen the vice chairman give second chances?

69
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,300
After acquiring a global airline which is ranked third in Korean business industries,

70
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,430
within 5 years, the goal is to prompt it to be the number one business nationally and to make it rank in the top ten businesses globally.

71
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,810
After it is announced that we'll be acquiring the global airline business, in order to get it moving

72
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,350
we'll be actively seeking relations and taking orders from America, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

73
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,190
If you look at the business plan for the current financial situation,

74
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,850
since the liquid assets are at 2.24 trillion won and the current liabilities are 0.94 trillion won,

75
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,880
the current liability ratio will be huge around 275 percent.

76
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,910
215.319149.

77
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,450
- Yes?
- If the liquid assets are at 2.24 trillion won,

78
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,390
and if the current liabilities are 0.94 trillion won,

79
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,600
shouldn't the current liability ratio be 215.319149 percent, President Park?

80
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,870
You're right, you're right. I wonder why the numbers are--

81
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,180
Go ahead with the acquisition.

82
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's end the meeting.

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,110
Oh, it's too war-like in here.

84
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,980
Isn't the Vice Chairman being too much?

85
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,300
My lifespan is shortening. How can I live on being this scared?

86
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,270
Oh, Vice Chairman!

87
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,870
It's not.

88
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,970
I agree with you, too.

89
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,000
Ah, I was so surprised. Since it's his friend, he doesn't want us to curse him, right?

90
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,960
He's been invited to a private party at the Spanish embassy.

91
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,090
Would it be okay if I called you back tomorrow, to reschedule?

92
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,040
- You've improved a lot.
- What?

93
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
Your English.

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,760
Just 9 years ago when we first went to America, you found it hard to interact with foreigners.

95
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,530
I was like that. It's all thanks to you, Vice Chairman.

96
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,830
You're right, my endless advice to you should have helped you quite a bit.

97
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,030
More than anything, when I had issues with my pronunciation or accents, you weren't hesitant to shame or reprimand me.

98
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,000
That stimulated me a lot.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,370
Shame and reprimand, you say?

100
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,360
Alright, if those help you improve, I'll keep doing the same.

101
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,960
- Thank you.
- But you know,

102
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,080
- you messed up earlier again.
- What?

103
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,130
It's not awc-cent, it's ack-cent.

104
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,190
I learned something again.

105
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,480
I apologize. It's because I have to wear a dress today.

106
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,230
I wasn't able to provide refreshments for you today because of the scheduled meeting. Are you okay?

107
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,650
I don't feel anything. You should know I get like this when I focus.

108
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,430
When I'm like this, I can't even feel hunger.

109
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,360
I'll prepare the refreshments.

110
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,900
This is the newly appointed Spanish ambassador.

111
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,890
Hello. Congratulations on your new position. (In Spanish)

112
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,970
I heard a lot about Vice Chairman Lee Yeong Joon even in Spain.

113
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,740
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

114
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,260
For the past four years, Yumyung Group has ranked first nationally for having a good business image, according to the consumer report.

115
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,220
The Bio Business has recently been approved by the US FDA. ( In English)

116
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,030
We were successful in achieving a trade surplus. (In French)

117
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,740
Working with China, knowing that they have a remarkable network of people. ( In Chinese)

118
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,190
We are planning a diverse array of businesses. (  In German)

119
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,500
- He's so cool.
- Isn't he handsome?

120
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,540
- Oh, he is cool.
- Right, right?

121
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,290
Look at his nose bridge!

122
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,300
He's really-- So, good-looking.

123
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,840
Our eyes met.

124
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,510
One second.

125
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,350
- He's coming this way. 
 - Does that make sense?

126
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,550
He's coming for me.

127
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,900
What? He's just passing by?

128
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,640
- Leaving me?
 - Mirror.

129
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,490
No way.

130
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,050
The ambassador is waiting for you.

131
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,300
Secretary Kim.

132
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,630
Yes?

133
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,530
How do I look right now?

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,200
Perfect.

135
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,350
Let's go.

136
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,780
When did you learn Spanish?

137
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,010
What do you mean, Spanish?

138
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,460
You were speaking earlier with the Spanish guys that were trying to pick you up, for quite some time.

139
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,560
Oh that!

140
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,540
I barely picked up English and Chinese, thanks to you.

141
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,060
Where do you think I found the time to learn Spanish? I just got by with my sensibility.

142
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,030
- Sensibility?
- Yes.

143
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,010
If they hand me champagne and look towards me, they probably meant, "excuse me for a moment."

144
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,950
When they look over at you and start speaking, they're all probably compliments,

145
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,140
- so I'd smile and nod my head in agreement.
 - Of course.

146
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,770
And when it looks like they're trying to pick me up, I touch my earring with my left hand.

147
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,220
Why is it your left hand?

148
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,730
If I show them my ring, it all gets taken care of.

149
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,810
This is the prize I earned at the last athletic competition.

150
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,480
Amazing.

151
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,450
After living for this long, I guess there does come a day when I'm complimented by you, Vice Chairman.

152
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,690
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,460
Anyway, you did well today. When it comes to purses or clothes that you want, let me know.

154
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,330
Rewards will encourage you even more.

155
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,090
Vice Chairman.

156
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,250
I'll refuse your rejection.

157
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,260
That's not it. I have something to say to you.

158
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,560
Don't confess to me. We're in a working relationship.

159
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,540
I wasn't thinking of doing that.

160
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,590
What do you want to say?

161
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,160
Vice Chairman, you should look for a new secretary.

162
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,680
I will now stop working.

163
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,960
Why, all of a sudden?

164
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,930
Just because, for personal reasons.

165
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,890
Then, do as you please.

166
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,850
Why can't I go to sleep?

167
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,370
Why are you all over the place again?

168
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,710
I have an incredible piece of news for you all.

169
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,230
What kind of incredible piece of news? You probably just heard some meaningless rumor.

170
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,670
My dear, this time. It's real.

171
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,290
Alright, those of you who can take it, gather here.

172
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,790
- Hurry and come here.
- I can't handle! I can't!

173
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,550
You know Secretary Kim?

174
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,850
What about Secretary Kim?

175
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,250
Secretary Kim

176
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,170
will resign, I heard.

177
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,490
What? You guys don't believe me?

178
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,970
Of course we don't. Why would Secretary Kim stop working?

179
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,420
She's receiving all the vice chairman's admiration. Why would she quit despite all that's going for her? That doesn't make sense.

180
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,780
It does make sense. I am really quitting.

181
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,290
Really?

182
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,280
Secretary Kim you really stopped working?

183
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,690
Yes, that's how it turned out.

184
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,990
Look, look, I was right. But wasn't it so sudden?

185
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,390
Why? Are you getting married? Are you getting an organ transplanted? Or studying abroad?

186
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,220
It's not any of those.

187
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,160
Then, is it because of the vice chairman's temperament?

188
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,950
It's also not that.

189
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,160
Then why?

190
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,670
Just because of personal reasons.

191
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,730
Vice Chairman is coming in.

192
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,300
Hello.

193
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,990
Hey, is it?

194
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,280
Should we go to her?

195
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,850
I never imagined that Secretary Kim would not be besides the Vice Chairman.

196
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,410
It doesn't feel real to me either.

197
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,270
I will miss you, Secretary Kim.

198
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,750
Then, normally around this time you should be preparing to bring him snacks.

199
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,800
The Darjeeling tea should always be served in this tea set.

200
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,340
The cookies should be from 'H' hotel and placed in threes.

201
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,790
Yes, well.

202
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,300
Why are you asking her that?

203
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,520
Why would I be asking? When Secretary Kim leaves, it's what I'll be doing.

204
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,320
Why is that?

205
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,550
If you look at Secretary Kim, it looks like the vice chairman has high standards when it comes to his secretary's looks.

206
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,370
When Secretary Kim leaves, the only person who could take her place is me.

207
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,930
Ah, these are moments when I'm so jealous of you.

208
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,050
I wish I looked normal like you too.

209
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,860
Since the vice chairman arrives at 7, that means I'll have to be here by 6:30.

210
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,000
I won't be able to sleep. What should I do?

211
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,780
Anyway, what should I do?

212
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,820
Hello.

213
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,120
Changing the swiveling chair, right?

214
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,040
- You're amazing.
- I know what's going on in your mind too.

215
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,080
You are not serious about quitting, are you?

216
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,500
This time, you're wrong.

217
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,180
What could possibly be the reason?

218
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,460
Is it because I made you work at night-time and on the weekends from last month?

219
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,530
I'll post a hiring notice during morning hours.

220
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,580
I'll narrow them down as much as possible, so all you'll have to do is attending the final interview.

221
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,530
You can take care of it.

222
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,270
Employment Eligibility and Requirements

223
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,440
It is sent.

224
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,820
Vice Chairman, do you need anything?

225
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,380
I'll be going to President Park's office now, reschedule the conference call to the afternoon.

226
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,120
Yes.

227
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,730
I'll be eating at my own house, so you should eat accordingly.

228
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,280
Alright.

229
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,570
Secretary Kim! Secretary Kim!

230
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,810
You haven't eaten lunch yet, right? You should eat with me!

231
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,130
Oh, I'm sorry but I have to leave due to personal reasons.

232
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,530
Without even eating? You should eat a little before going!

233
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,740
I'm sorry! Next time!

234
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,970
Really, I wanted to receive some advice about her job while eating.

235
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,070
I'm busy too.

236
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,730
- What could be the reason?
- What?

237
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,390
The reason for suddenly quitting.

238
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,540
Ah. your secretary. The secretary.

239
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,390
There was nothing I didn't know until now. But with this, there's no way of knowing.

240
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,680
I'm so frustrated that it makes me dizzy.

241
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,290
Is that so?

242
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,750
When your blood sugar is low, red ginseng jelly is the best!

243
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,440
Do you want one?

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,790
Are you telling me to eat a bundle of sugar that contains probably around 0.03% of red ginseng?

245
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,130
Never mind, tell me.

246
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,830
Why did Secretary Kim do that?

247
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,720
Oh, I really don't know.

248
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,560
She has worked for you for nine years. That's a long time to endure.

249
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,070
With a woman like that, in the east we call her Bodhisattva and in the west they call her a saintâ€”

250
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,430
What did I just say?

251
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,590
Nine years?

252
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,140
Ni-ni-nine years?

253
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,790
The time has come.

254
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,100
I think it's right when they say it comes in 3, 6, or 9.

255
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,220
3, 6 , or 9?

256
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,090
A rough patch in the relationship.

257
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,050
You know that the love my wife and I share was so destined to be that I married her within the month we met, right?

258
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,530
I know that well. And for your 10th anniversary, instead of gifts you guys exchanged divorce papers.

259
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,820
You just now, you were bad. You were really bad.

260
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,170
At first, we were really! We were reallyâ€”

261
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,000
passionate.

262
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,010
But, the words that were shared on our third anniversary were,

263
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,750
Honey, I love you.

264
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,800
Why do you think I fell in love with a man like you?

265
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,180
During our sixth wedding anniversaryâ€”

266
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,730
Waiter.

267
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,500
Sorry, just looking at the back of your head makes me want to beat you.

268
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,940
And during the ninth anniversary of our weddingâ€”

269
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,500
Even the air you breathe seems to be wasteful, so stop breathing, you bastard!

270
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,610
No way.

271
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,110
By any chance, are you crying?

272
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,110
Can I cry?

273
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,450
No.

274
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,240
If I look back,

275
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,740
whenever 3, 6, or 9 came, we were in a standoff.

276
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,210
Like a bruised apple.

277
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,530
A bruised apple?

278
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,270
Look here.

279
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,320
You can eat around the bruised part, but you get lazy

280
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,240
so you pick out another fresh-looking fruit.

281
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,770
And eat that first.

282
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,310
But if you leave the bruised apple, with the other apples. What will happen?

283
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,240
Then even all the other apples, get bruised too!

284
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,860
All of them get bruised and rot away.

285
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,010
What-- What are you even trying to say?

286
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,140
Before the bruise digs deeper and rots more, find a breakthrough via communication.

287
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,330
A breakthrough, you say...

288
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,140
That's easy.

289
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,640
If you need advice on reaching a breakthrough, come find me.

290
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,510
You divorced her because you couldn't find that breakthrough.

291
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,310
That's right.

292
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,910
This is the payment for the loan. This is the last one, right?

293
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,320
Yes.

294
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,650
Is your name Secretary Kim?

295
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,160
Oh no. No.

296
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,120
Kim Mi So.

297
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,510
Here.

298
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,130
Yes.

299
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes, Vice Chairman.

300
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,960
Right now?

301
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,570
Me too?

302
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,450
- We'll be going to his residence now.
- Yes.

303
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,930
You spoke as if you were going back home alone, but why are we going together all of a sudden?

304
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,910
A breakthrough, huh?

305
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,410
Yes?

306
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,250
I'm not someone who gives second chances.

307
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,320
- Yes, of course. 
- But to Secretary Kim, specially, I want to give one more chance.

308
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,840
- What? 
- This opportunity won't come again, so you should be thankful.

309
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,740
I'll promote you to a director position!

310
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,470
- Ah, that's not it.
- If you have too much work, I'll hire another secretary under you. And the company will cover the costs.

311
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,140
If you want, I can even buy you a house with my own personal funds.

312
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,380
Did you take of all the debts you have at home? I'll even take care of those debts.

313
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,320
Then, from now on, work to the best of your ability.

314
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,020
- Vice Chairman.
- I can promise you.

315
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,850
Wherever you go, you won't be able to find this sort of treatment. And also!

316
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,810
Wherever you go, you won't be able to serve under such a perfect boss.

317
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,050
Even if you jump at this opportunity, I won't call you superficial. So just accept it and keep working.

318
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,590
- But the thing is--
- Yeong Joon!

319
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,300
Secretary Kim, you came?

320
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,050
Right. Right. My dear.

321
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,790
- Please go in. 
- Okay, let's go in.

322
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,720
I told you to come more frequently.

323
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,560
Even if we're in the same building, it's so hard to see your face.

324
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,140
I was a bit busy because of the Executive Director Jo incident.

325
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,360
Executive Director Jo was an asset. Did you really have to go that far with him?

326
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,810
It only takes one moment for a company's image to crumble.

327
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,460
Since you trrusted me and left it in my hands, please let me handle it.

328
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,610
You're right, you're right. You're doing great, Yeong Joon.

329
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,360
Honey, of course, Yeong Joon will take care of everything.

330
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,440
You're right, I was being careless.

331
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,650
Oh, sorry.

332
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,200
Did you two also have this period of time: a state of ennui.

333
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,820
A state of ennui?

334
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,540
How did we ever feel disconnected?

335
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,750
As we converse, it's all solved.

336
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,400
There's no one like the chairman.

337
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,530
Let's eat.

338
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,510
Secretary Kim, eat a lot.

339
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,640
Hasn't Yeong Joon gotten more handsome recently?

340
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,280
Not really, it's all because of you, Mother.

341
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,670
It's the reason why I respect you, Mother.

342
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,850
Recently, the Bio Business has been approved by the US FDA and we're working on acquiring the global airline.

343
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,980
Father?

344
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,820
You seem to have something to say judging by your awkward fake cough.

345
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,570
Are you really not planning on getting married?

346
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,080
Yes.

347
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,300
I really-- I, why am I like this?

348
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,280
Are you okay?

349
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,810
Do I look okay?

350
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,900
I don't think I'll be able to go on for long.

351
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I saw your health exam results. You seem to be very healthy.

352
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,340
How do they know anything?! I know my body the best!

353
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,270
Before dying, your father wants to see grandchildren for once!

354
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,860
I don't look for any prerequisites in my daughter-in-law.

355
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,990
I heard Secretary Kim quit!

356
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,580
There is no way. I won't let her.

357
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,820
The weather is really nice.

358
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,860
About Yeong Joon...

359
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,760
I heard that he does bring women to social gatherings here and there,

360
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,780
but it doesn't last long.

361
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:53,280
I don't think he's sincerely meeting them. He says he's only doing it to show others.

362
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,630
Is that really the case?

363
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,240
Yes, I think so.

364
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,970
I heard that he won't even let women touch him. Is that true?

365
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,960
Yes.

366
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,830
So, our Yeong Joon...

367
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,520
perhaps...

368
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,230
is he ga- ga- ga-...

369
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,350
ga- ga- ga- ga-...

370
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,980
Gay?

371
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,660
Oh, it's not anything like that!

372
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,840
Really?

373
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,490
Of course. I've been by his side for a long time, so I know better than anyone.

374
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,080
I'm so relieved.

375
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,680
To be honest, even if the chairman and I couldn't say anything, we were very worried.

376
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,690
Since Yeong Joon is very wary of women other than you.

377
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,770
I was thinking that maybe the rumors were true.

378
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,340
When it comes to Yeong Joon,

379
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,190
how do you think women view him?

380
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,960
It's the best of course. Ability, charm, personality.

381
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,720
Without anything missing, a perfect person.

382
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,680
Isn't that right? You definitely know how to discern people, Secretary Kim!

383
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,200
I would be so happy if someone married our Yeong Joon.

384
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,110
For example, someone like you.

385
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,030
Just a joke.

386
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,690
If there was someone like Secretary Kim out there, I'd immediately send Yeong Joon her way.

387
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,620
Just joking, a joke.

388
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,980
Secretary Kim, you should leave.

389
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

390
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,440
Then, Madam, I will leave.

391
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,330
Did my mother make you uncomfortable?

392
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,580
Yes, but

393
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,700
I think she was somehow trying to tie you and me together.

394
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,460
So, were you expecting something like that to happen?

395
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,420
No.

396
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,010
It gave me an even clearer conviction on why I should quit soon so we don't receive any further misunderstandings.

397
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,480
What?

398
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,560
I thought that conversation ended earlier. You should know that was an incredible offer!

399
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,520
Yes.

400
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,620
Of course, I know the offer you gave was incredible, but I still want to quit.

401
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,990
Sorry. I can't yield for this.

402
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,040
Don't trigger my competitiveness.

403
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,740
Let me do it.

404
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,110
It's an occupational hazard. I have an obsession in setting everything.

405
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,500
Mi So, let's eat together now.

406
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,580
Unnis*, help yourselves as well.
(elder sisters)

407
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,110
But, my unnis' faces don't look good. Is hospital work too harsh?

408
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,430
Mi So, from now on, don't worry about us.

409
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,940
Your unni couldn't take care of her dongsaengs.

410
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,120
Because of me being ambitious, you had to suffer a lot.

411
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,050
What suffering! You also helped to clear the debts midway.

412
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,520
And you two didn't cause a problem like Dad at least.

413
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,580
A problem?

414
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,980
Dad cause a problem again?

415
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,630
To be honest, in the beginning of this year I found out about his loan shark debts.

416
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,970
- Around three million won?
- What three million?

417
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,730
Why are you telling us only now, Mi So?

418
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,590
You would've been worried if I had told you earlier.

419
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,160
So how did it go?

420
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,460
I solved it by selling my car.

421
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,780
You had a car?

422
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,850
Our Vice Chairman bought it for me because I missed the bus and was late to work for 10 minutes.

423
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,520
I sold it after using it for one week.

424
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,710
I feel so relieved now, after clearing our debts.

425
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,920
Your laughing face is bothering me a lot.

426
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,220
I think it's funny.

427
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,690
Exactly what is funny?

428
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,670
As I think about it now, it's not really funny.

429
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,070
She had been working with me for a long time.

430
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,580
How can she be so relaxed like that?

431
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,680
Didn't you say you met her every day just for work?

432
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,660
What is the reason (for her to quit)?

433
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,140
Do you think Secretary Mi So acted that way to receive an incredible offer?

434
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,530
Think about it carefully. Something might have triggered her to quit on that day.

435
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,190
That day...

436
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,760
Aura!

437
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,350
Ack-cent.

438
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,610
I want to resign now.

439
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,630
Oppa Yeong Joon.

440
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,390
Oh Ji Ran?

441
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,870
I'm going crazy.

442
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,000
You should take your allergy medicine.

443
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,310
Why are you the only one in our family with pollen allergy?

444
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,420
Thanks, Unni.

445
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,470
It was worth me supporting you guys through school.

446
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,820
We don't have any right to face you.

447
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,020
Sorry. It's burnt.

448
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,480
Why do you touch flowers when you have pollen allergy?

449
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,040
Your Vice Chairman ordered you again?

450
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,240
Oppa Yeong Joon!

451
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,330
Why are you here?

452
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,780
I got invited as a celebrity. I saw your name on the invitation list,

453
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,010
so I came here secretly to surprise you.

454
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,950
You should have called me. You came with Secretary Kim because you thought I might be busy, right?

455
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,900
But, Oppa, do I look different somewhere?

456
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,140
The necklace suits you.

457
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,320
This is from you, Oppa.

458
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,340
And, what day is today?

459
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,270
My birthday!

460
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:53,090
Ji Ran just needs some flowers.

461
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,850
- Give me some flowers. 
 - What type of flowers do you want?

462
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,340
 Flowers. Flower bouquet. A big one.

463
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,890
Thank you, Oppa. You're the best indeed.

464
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,100
They are so pretty.

465
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,250
You are saying Secretary Kim cried?

466
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,650
I thought I was mistaken then.

467
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,390
Secretary Kim's eyes were wet.

468
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,080
Her eyes were moist?

469
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,260
Then, she may think "do I need to buy a bouquet for another girl?"

470
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,960
"That's too dirty. I can't continue working anymore."  Did she  say anything?

471
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,050
No, no. That's not the reason.

472
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,860
I think I know it now. The reason Secretary Kim resigned.

473
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,560
I have a bad feeling towards what you're suspecting.

474
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,050
Why didn't I know about that?

475
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,400
Yeong Joon, this fellow.

476
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,610
Yeong Joon, this fellow?

477
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,790
What exactly  is it?

478
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,420
That personal reason, that unspeakable reason, her eyes.

479
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,930
- Secretary Kim. 
- Secretary Kim.

480
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,880
Secretary Kim

481
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,190
likes me.

482
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,240
Like me? Nonsense.

483
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,570
No, but why not? Didn't he give you a bunch of clothes and shoes as gifts?

484
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,680
Even if it's so that you look your part, isn't that going a bit overboard?

485
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,500
Vice Chairman likes you. That's confirmed.

486
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,300
No way. Never.

487
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,320
He loves himself too much, to the point that he can't even be satisfied with others.

488
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,690
Liking someone else? Falling in love? Not even once.

489
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,480
- Does that make sense? 
 -  I said it's true.

490
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,290
Never loved anyone at that age?

491
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,630
He has his secretary.

492
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,570
- Do you want to eat this?  
 - Eat it, Unni.

493
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,430
I was very careful to prevent her from falling for me.

494
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,280
How considerate you are.

495
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,590
Indeed, if Secretary Kim doesn't have feelings for me after being together for 9 years, she's not a human being but a robot.

496
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,050
Don't be so sure about that.

497
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,490
Secretary Kim, really. We are just working partners.

498
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes, that's the reason. She likes me, indeed.

499
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,610
Why does it matter if I like him or hate him?

500
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,360
Vice Chairman and I aren't like that. We just work together.

501
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,070
Also, I just quit working at the company.

502
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,380
- You quit? 
- Why did you quit out of the blue?

503
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,280
Did the Vice Chairman pick on you? Oh, that bastard!

504
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,500
No, it's not like that. Now both Father and Unnis have settled down.

505
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,930
And we've paid off our debt. That's why I wanted to quit.

506
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,910
What are you going to do now that you quit?

507
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,750
I still don't know.

508
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,040
It is a pity somehow, because at my age and with my skill-set, it will be hard to find similar benefits.

509
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,500
But, I'm too busy. Plus, if I don't leave now, I feel like I'll never be able to leave.

510
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,490
And also--

511
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,880
Vice Chairman

512
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,220
It's the vice chairman, isn't it?

513
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,820
- Don't answer it.
- Don't answer it. You, don't answer it.

514
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,730
- Don't answer it!
- I said don't answer it!

515
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,740
Yes, Vice Chairman.

516
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,000
You know where I'm at, right? Head over immediately.

517
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,880
Vice Chairman, I have some work to do at the moment. For today only, could you ask Secretary Yang,

518
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,770
or how about I send over a designated driver?

519
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,840
How can I trust them?

520
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,020
Is he telling you to come over now? Hey, give the phone to me.

521
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,280
Oh, then call Ji Ran! For today only, you could sleep with Ji Ran--

522
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,590
Head over immediately.

523
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,590
Vice Chairman? Hello?

524
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,800
Is he telling you to come over now? To come over and drive?

525
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,480
Even if he stays the night out today, there's no one that would say anything.

526
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,480
But I don't know why he's so obsessed with going back to his own house.

527
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,480
That's what I'm saying. It's a relief that you're quitting! A relief!

528
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,100
Where was that key again?

529
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,740
Mi So, I'll take care of it!

530
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,500
Hurry and kill it! Kill it!

531
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,050
It's dead! It's dead!

532
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,230
Mi So, are you okay?

533
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,190
Do you still have a phobia of spiders?

534
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,360
Unni, did I really not get lost when I was young once?

535
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,260
Around when I was four or five?

536
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,660
You're saying stuff like that again. Even when that never happened.

537
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,770
Liking me to that extent,

538
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,490
of course she was upset that I made her buy flowers for another woman.

539
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,060
Secretary Kim, I'll break up with Oh Ji Ran. That will do, right?

540
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,030
Yeong Joon, you were incredibly sharp this time around!

541
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,280
What is he doing? Is Yeong Joon talking to Yeong Joon?

542
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,390
Vice Chairman, I have come.

543
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,270
You cry again and you make someone embarrassed again. Do you like it that much?

544
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,730
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,550
Throw it away.

546
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,200
Sorry, and also, I will put these flowers in the trunk.

547
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,330
Was it that moving?  Anyway, I can't stop myself.

548
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,940
Sorry.

549
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,970
Who were you with?

550
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,160
It's a secret.

551
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,970
I will end with Oh Ji Ran. That will do, right?

552
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,150
Do you have other woman now?

553
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,970
I won't meet someone else for a while. That will do, right?

554
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,720
Why do you keep asking me if that will do?

555
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,950
I didn't sleep with her. It's satisfying, right?

556
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,560
- What? 
- I said I didn't sleep with Oh Ji Ran.

557
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,160
We have a business relationship, Secretary Kim. You know that too.

558
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,260
Yes, of course, I know well.

559
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,000
How much you suffered all this time... I understand it a little.

560
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,740
So, tomorrow rest the whole day and think about it again. It's a special holiday for you.

561
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,350
Really?

562
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,860
But I have an interview for my substitute tomorrow.

563
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,880
Just come for the interview.

564
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,600
Yes. Thank you.

565
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,910
After you quit, did you find a place to go to?

566
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,530
Not yet.

567
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,220
Are you going to stay in Seoul?

568
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,740
I'm still not sure about that.

569
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,160
If you don't have any basic plan, then why did you quit?

570
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,030
I want to now find my life.

571
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,290
What does that mean?

572
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:19,120
No one's secretary, no one's family member, just the life of Kim Mi So.

573
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,710
Then the time she spent with me, was it not her life?

574
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,050
Pimple??

575
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,770
How dare you came out on my impeccable forehead.

576
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,390
How long has it been since I last slept in?

577
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,350
This is so nice.

578
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,410
I should wake up.

579
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,870
Vice Chairman Lee Yeong Joon's Daily Log

580
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,290
I slept too much.

581
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,200
Who did this investment contract, you yourself?  Thanks.

582
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,180
Hello.

583
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,520
I need a change of pace.

584
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,430
 Resignation letter  
 Kim Mi So  

585
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,300
How long has it been since I went to work during the day?

586
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,100
It's so nice.

587
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,860
Hello?

588
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,270
Ji Eun, what should we eat for dinner?

589
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,990
It's me, who else? Secre--, no, Kim Mi So.

590
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,820
You didn't erase my number, did you?

591
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:17,650
What's with you? Yesterday you said that's just a lump of sugar with 0.03% of red ginseng.

592
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,420
What kind of bullcrap does she mean by trying to find her life?

593
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,690
With the standard 8-hour workday, over 9 years is 18,000 hours.

594
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,830
Secretary Kim didn't take weekends and holidays off over 9 years,

595
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,580
then it's a total of 59,130 hours.

596
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,360
The time she spent with me is more than most couples, so how can she say it has no meaning?

597
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,780
She said it has no meaning? Pity.

598
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,470
Did she get hurt because she liked me so much?

599
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,140
Even though Secretary Kim did her job really well and you feel comfortable with her, still you seem to pay too much attention.

600
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,800
- Could it be... that you like Secretary Kim? 
 - Have you lost your marbles?

601
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,860
Then why are you worried to this extent?

602
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,900
Other than Secretary Kim, you never let any girl touch you.

603
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,370
Truthfully, there's an abundance of girls around you.

604
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,580
I've never seen you do skinship before.

605
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,220
Do you have trauma with women?

606
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,820
I just hate women.

607
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,160
- Secretary Kim? 
 - Secretary Kim is different though.

608
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,820
She's a woman. What's different?

609
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,050
Secretary Kim is just

610
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,700
Kim Mi So.

611
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,960
Never mind. I'm leaving.

612
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,920
What is he saying?

613
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,500
Here is the weekly report.

614
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,630
Are you just going to drink it? Should I heat it up for you?

615
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,930
No, it's okay.

616
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,650
You have to heat it up. It'll be better for your health.

617
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,790
It's fine, I'll just eat it.

618
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,760
Well, I said you have to take it warm, give it to--

619
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,050
Sorry. I just wanted to heat it up.

620
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,360
Even though you didn't get to heat up the red ginseng, you sure heat up my insides (meaning made me angry).

621
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,120
Perhaps, Secretary Seol, do you not have thoughts of quitting?

622
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,690
No. I will always be by your side.

623
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,990
Always?

624
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,460
- Leave. 
 - Yes.

625
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,950
Do you know the secretary guidelines?

626
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,810
You have to be closemouthed but fast on your feet.

627
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,820
Since even I did it without experience or qualifications.

628
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,690
Think coolly. Feel warmly. Run like your feet are on fire.

629
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,370
You will do a good job.

630
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,430
And the last thing I wish to tell the secretary taking over for me,

631
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:51,320
the reason I am quitting, and more than anything, the most important thing is...

632
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,830
Vice Chairman.

633
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,930
You don't look so good. Are you not feeling well?

634
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,270
I couldn't sleep. Secretary Kim, you look fine though.

635
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,850
I slept a lot thanks to you.

636
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,390
Did you get a pimple on your forehead?

637
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,530
- Should I call dermatologist Dr. Yoon?
 - It's fine.

638
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:21,770
Or should I get a prescription from Dr. Jeon for a sleeping pill?

639
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,940
Are you worried about me right now?

640
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,990
What? Of course I'm worried.

641
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,650
Then are you Secretary Kim or Kim Mi So?

642
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,850
What do you mean?

643
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,060
Vice Chairman, the replacement for Secretary Kim is here for her interview. Should I let her in now?

644
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,650
Tell her to come in now. Secretary Kim, join as well, since she is your replacement.

645
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,610
Yes.

646
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,900
Vice Chairman, I pulled together some questions.

647
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,300
Kim Ji Ah, if you become Secretary Kim, how would you be called?

648
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,320
Secretary Kim or Kim Ji Ah.

649
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,220
I will go by Secretary Kim Ji Ah.

650
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,120
It's Kim Ji Ah, and not Secretary Kim.

651
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,420
Secretary Kim, ask questions as well.

652
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,940
Yes.

653
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,720
Could you speak on the duties of a secretary?

654
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,900
Having the mindset of caring for your boss as you would for a childâ€”

655
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,210
What do you think it would be like working for a boss that was 100% perfect?

656
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,910
Oh, my heart would race.

657
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:41,420
Do you think you could 100% match a boss that's 100% perfect. Do you think you could satisfy that person?

658
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,890
That must be quite difficult.

659
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,020
Can you take the responsibility not to quit your job with an excuse

660
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,550
as abstract as personal reasons?

661
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,280
I will totally bury my bones here (meaning I will work until I die).

662
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,270
While you work, you may actually bury your bones (meaning you may die with overload of work).

663
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,830
What? It's that hard?

664
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,420
The compensation for your efforts is the best in the nation.

665
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,950
You'll definitely be compensated, but your identity as Kim Ji Ah will be erased. You'll just remain as Secretary Kim.

666
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,400
Then has the time you've been working not been a part of your life, Kim Mi So?

667
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,600
If you pick me, I'll do my best!

668
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,000
You pass!

669
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,440
- Really? 
 - Assistant Manager Park.

670
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,740
- Yes.
 - Show Secretary Kim Ji Ah around. She'll be the new Secretary Kim.

671
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,230
Secretary Kim, take charge and make Secretary Kim an exact copy of you. Then leave.

672
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,850
Yes.

673
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,120
Thank you.

674
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,550
Wait. "You'll find your own life." Exactly what does that mean?

675
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:44,850
Since I've only lived my life working until now, I want to make time for myself.

676
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,230
And?

677
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:52,010
And  I'm already 29.

678
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,840
I should date and get married.

679
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,920
What?

680
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,420
I was like that.

681
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,860
What's the occasion? Secretary Kim comes out to gatherings?

682
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,500
Sorry. From now on, don't meet up without me. I now have a lot of time.

683
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:22,160
You were on the news too, right next to the vice chairman.

684
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,290
You were so cool.

685
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,380
Right. Mi So you were the one that studied the hardest out of all of us.

686
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:32,390
A total career woman. I'm totally jealous. I'm just an ahjumma.

687
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,360
I'm so tired of looking after the kids!

688
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,770
At least you're the traditional housewife! Look at me. I'm working while looking after my kid.

689
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,980
Mi So, don't get married.

690
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,790
Yeah, definitely don't!

691
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,120
- Why?
 - If you get married, you have these kinds of stories.

692
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,980
Right?

693
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,190
I'm going to the restroom.

694
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,770
Oh, my bad.

695
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:51,250
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

696
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,990
What is this? A man's handkerchief, necktie, and lighter?

697
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,510
Whose bag is this?

698
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,920
It's mine. You never know when the Vice Chairman may need those.

699
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,460
A career woman lives like this.

700
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,190
Let's get on!

701
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,340
Let's sit here.

702
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,850
Your babies are so small.

703
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,610
Alright.

704
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,050
Yeah.

705
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,220
Is your name Secretary Kim?

706
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,170
  Oh no, Kim Mi So. 

707
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,600
Secretary Kim

708
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,120
Kim Mi So.

709
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,930
 Here. 

710
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,390
Taking Over the New Occupation Manual

711
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,690
The most important thing

712
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,410
is to make sure to have time for yourself.

713
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,040
Your predecessor, Kim Mi So.

714
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,840
Taking Over the New Occupation Manual

715
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,600
It's all done.

716
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:08,050
One's own time? Life? Dating? Marriage?

717
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:12,460
How could she say things like that to me, as if I were a stranger?

718
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,470
Who?

719
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,470
- How am I? 
 - What?

720
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:19,960
How am I?

721
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,300
What's new? Of course, you're  the perfect man.

722
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,820
Capable, good looking, tall, well-mannered.

723
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,950
And, sexy.

724
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,500
But why did Secretary Kim do that?

725
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,720
What? What did Secretary Kim do?

726
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,970
Are you talking about another girl in front of me?

727
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,220
Kim Mi So

728
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,760
 To my brother 

729
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,860
Who is this?

730
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,760
Vice Chairman, why are you here at this time?

731
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,430
First, please come in.

732
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,750
Don't order me around. I'll talk outside.

733
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,950
Sure.

734
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,320
Dating and marriage, were you being serious?

735
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:53,530
Did you come all the way here at this time just to ask about that?

736
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:57,950
Why, so suddenly? Was there a person you met without me knowing?

737
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,490
Vice Chairman, are you angry?

738
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,530
No, it doesn't matter to me who you meet. Why would I be angry?

739
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,320
That's what I'm saying.

740
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,810
Just answer the questions I'm asking.

741
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,470
I don't have someone I'm meeting secretly.

742
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,450
Of course it had to be that.

743
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,460
- What? 
- What?

744
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,320
There's no reason for me to meet with someone else without you knowing. And did I even have the time to do so?

745
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,920
I always got to work at 6 AM, and I didn't know when I'd get off.

746
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,220
When you call me, even when I'm sleeping, I'll get right up and head to you.

747
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,640
So? You're having a hard time convincing me.

748
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,160
If I continue to keep working by your side,

749
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,060
I can't get married, I feel like I'll get older.

750
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:40,110
Only... for that reason?

751
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:43,150
'Only... for that reason?'

752
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:50,120
When I get older and can't stay by your side any longer, who will take care of me when I'm jobless?

753
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,860
Alright. I promise you'll have your job for your entire lifetime.

754
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,490
I dislike that even more.

755
01:00:55,490 --> 01:01:01,090
You're telling me to stay by your side and get lonelier as I age.

756
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:11,120
So, to get married, you have to quit the company?

757
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,140
Yes.

758
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,020
You want to get married that bad?

759
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,660
Yes.

760
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,750
Then keep doing your work.

761
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:30,360
I, Lee Yeong Joon, will let you marry me.

762

Timing and Subtitles brought by The Perfect Secretaries Team @ Viki

â™¬ Between you and me, between the two of us, like a scent â™¬

01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,970

â™¬ It's quite rough â™¬

769

What's Wrong With Secretary Kim

770
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:09,790
 I'm going to date now. 

771
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,970
Is trying to keep Secretary Kim on the level of completing a company merger?

772
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,060
Write where you'd want to go with someone you have feelings for.

773
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,690
Who wants to go get pork spareribs?

774
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,690
Yeah! I do, I do!

775
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,520
Our department store's liquor income is our weakness butâ€” 

776
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,440
When we're eating, we don't talk about work.

777
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,700
Secretary Kim, when it comes to places like the noraebang â€”

778
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,640
Then, why don't you just go back?

779
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,660
Okay, I said okay. Why do you have so much to say? 

780
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,860
I'm just answering the questions you asked.

781
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,100
Look at this, look at this again. Talking back to me! Secretary Kim.

782
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,140
 Yes? 

783
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:46,600
Secretary Kim, happy and romantic days like today, will become your daily lifestyle from now on.

784
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,060
â™¬ My heart is spreading towards yours â™¬
